# Cashew Processing Dashboard

This is a web application for managing and visualizing cashew batch processing data. The application supports user authentication, data entry, and dashboard views for different processing stages like shelling, peeling, and grading.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Login and logout functionality with JWT-based authentication.
- **Data Management**: Add, view, and manage cashew batch data through forms.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize output ratios using charts for various processing stages.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Chart.js, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Expected REST API for data handling (e.g., Node.js, Django).
- **Authentication**: JWT-based token authentication.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Backend API running to serve data and handle authentication

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cashew-dashboard.git
   cd cashew-dashboard
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install 
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
4. Ensure the backend API is running at /api



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
